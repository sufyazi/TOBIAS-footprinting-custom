# For TOBIAS, we need to merge individual peak files into a single peak file for each sample.

# The list of selected peak files per samples are:
# 1. bfilt.narrowPeak true rep
# 2. idr.conservative.narrowPeak true rep
# 3. idr.optimal.narrowPeak true rep
# 4. overlap.optimal.narrowPeak true rep
# 5. overlap.conservative.narrowPeak true rep

# let us gather the necessary files in one place first
# make sure that a copy of 'peak' folder for each sample of a dataset (use the flag --relative with rsync) has been transferred from the storage server to where this merging would be done.

# ensure that the structure in the peak_root folder below is as follows, with raw_peaks and merged_peaks as subfolders:
# peak_root
# ├── merged_peaks
# └── raw_peaks

# check if argument is provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
	echo "No arguments provided. Please provide the path to the peak_root folder."	
	exit 1
fi

# change directory to the atac_croo_out folder
croo_root=$1

# grab the basename of all the datasets based on the subfolders in the current directory
